# Peace Of Mind

Peace of Mind is a final project for the WeCanCodeIT! Bootcamp located in Columbus, OH.
The Application is meant to function as an aid for individuals in the early stages of Alzheimer's or Dementia
to help them track their medications and their emotions day-to-day, as well as provide a centralized Dashboard
with quick access to information such as their emergency contact, their home address and their medical care
professional to help give them some autonomy.
It also features linked accounts for the patient's caregiver(emergency contact) and medical care professional
where they will be able to quickly review their patient's adherence to their medications and view their most
recent logged emotional status. Giving them the ability to assist without needing to maintain an oppressive
constant physical presence.
